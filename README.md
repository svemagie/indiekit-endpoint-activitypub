# @svemagie/indiekit-endpoint-activitypub

ActivityPub federation endpoint for [Indiekit](https://getindiekit.com), built on [Fedify](https://fedify.dev) 2.0. Makes your IndieWeb site a full fediverse actor — discoverable, followable, and interactive from Mastodon, Misskey, Pixelfed, and any ActivityPub-compatible platform.

This is a fork of [@rmdes/indiekit-endpoint-activitypub](https://github.com/rmdes/indiekit-endpoint-activitypub) by [Ricardo Mendes](https://rmendes.net) ([@rick@rmendes.net](https://rmendes.net)), adding direct message (DM) support.

## Changes in this fork

### Direct messages (DMs)

Private ActivityPub messages (messages addressed only to your actor, with no `as:Public` in `to` or `cc`) are now detected, stored, and handled separately from public mentions.

**Receiving DMs**
- Incoming `Create(Note)` activities with no public audience are flagged as direct messages
- Stored in `ap_notifications` with `isDirect: true` and `senderActorUrl`
- Displayed in a dedicated **🔒 Direct** tab in the notifications view
- Cards are visually distinguished with an `ap-notification--direct` CSS class and a 🔒 badge instead of the @ mention badge

**Threaded conversation view**
- The **🔒 Direct** tab groups messages by conversation partner instead of showing a flat list
- Each conversation shows a chat-style thread: received messages on the left, sent replies on the right, in chronological order
- An inline reply form at the bottom of each thread lets you reply without leaving the page
- Sent replies are stored in `ap_notifications` with `direction: "outbound"` so they persist in the thread across reloads
- After sending, the page redirects back to `?tab=mention` so the updated thread is immediately visible

**Replying to DMs**
- The inline thread reply form (and the standalone compose form) both bypass Micropub — no public blog post is created
- A native ActivityPub `Create(Note)` is built with `to` set only to the sender's actor URL and sent via `ctx.sendActivity()`
- The note is never broadcast to followers or the public collection
- Syndication targets are hidden for DM replies

**Detection**
- Incoming `Create(Note)` activities are classified as direct messages when neither `to` nor `cc` contains `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public`
- Tags are iterated via Fedify's `note.getTags()` async generator with `instanceof Mention` / `instanceof Hashtag` checks (Fedify 2.x does not expose a synchronous `.tag` property)

## Features

**Federation**
- Full ActivityPub actor with WebFinger, NodeInfo, HTTP Signatures, and Object Integrity Proofs (Ed25519)
- Outbox syndication — posts created via Micropub are automatically delivered to followers
- Inbox processing — receives follows, likes, boosts, replies, mentions, direct messages, deletes, and account moves
- Content negotiation — ActivityPub clients requesting your site get JSON-LD; browsers get HTML
- Reply delivery — replies are addressed to and delivered directly to the original post's author
- Shared inbox support with collection sync (FEP-8fcf)
- Configurable actor type (Person, Service, Organization, Group)

**Reader**
- Timeline view showing posts from followed accounts with tab filtering (notes, articles, replies, boosts, media)
- Explore view — browse public timelines from any Mastodon-compatible instance
- Cross-instance hashtag search — search a hashtag across multiple fediverse instances
- Tag timeline — view and follow/unfollow specific hashtags
- Post detail view with threaded context
- Quote post embeds — quoted posts render as inline cards with author, content, and timestamp (FEP-044f, Misskey, Fedibird formats)
- Link preview cards via Open Graph metadata unfurling
- Notifications for likes, boosts, follows, mentions, replies, and **direct messages**
- Compose form with dual-path posting (quick AP reply, native AP DM reply, or Micropub blog post)
- Native interactions (like, boost, reply, follow/unfollow from the reader)
- Remote actor profile pages
- Content warnings and sensitive content handling
- Media display (images, video, audio)
- Infinite scroll with IntersectionObserver-based auto-loading
- New post banner — polls for new items and offers one-click loading

- Popular accounts autocomplete in the fediverse lookup bar
- Configurable timeline retention

**Moderation**
- Mute actors or keywords
- Block actors (also removes from followers)
- All moderation actions available from the reader UI

**Mastodon Migration**
- Import following/followers lists from Mastodon CSV exports
- Set `alsoKnownAs` alias for account Move verification
- Batch re-follow processor — gradually sends Follow activities to imported accounts
- Progress tracking with pause/resume controls

**Public Profile**
- Standalone profile page at the actor URL (HTML fallback for browsers)
- Shows avatar, bio, profile fields, follower/following/post counts, and follow prompt
- Dark mode support via system preference

**Debug Dashboard**
- Optional [Fedify Debugger](https://github.com/fedify-dev/debugger) integration
- Password-protected dashboard at `{mountPath}/__debug__/`
- OpenTelemetry tracing for federation activity
- Real-time activity inspection

**Admin UI**
- Dashboard with follower/following counts and recent activity
- Profile editor (name, bio, avatar, header, profile links with rel="me" verification)
- Pinned posts (featured collection)
- Featured tags (hashtag collection)
- Activity log (inbound/outbound)
- Follower and following lists with source tracking

## Requirements

- [Indiekit](https://getindiekit.com) v1.0.0-beta.25+
- [Fedify](https://fedify.dev) 2.0+ (bundled as dependency)
- Node.js >= 22
- MongoDB (used by Indiekit)
- Redis (recommended for production delivery queue; in-process queue available for development)

## Installation

Install from GitHub:

```bash
npm install github:svemagie/indiekit-endpoint-activitypub
```

Or pin to this fork in `package.json` while keeping the original package name (matches the upstream override pattern):

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@rmdes/indiekit-endpoint-activitypub": "github:svemagie/indiekit-endpoint-activitypub"
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Add the plugin to your Indiekit config:

```javascript
// indiekit.config.js
export default {
  plugins: [
    "@rmdes/indiekit-endpoint-activitypub",
  ],
  "@rmdes/indiekit-endpoint-activitypub": {
    mountPath: "/activitypub",
    actor: {
      handle: "yourname",
      name: "Your Name",
      summary: "A short bio",
      icon: "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
    },
  },
};
```

### All Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mountPath` | string | `"/activitypub"` | URL prefix for all plugin routes |
| `actor.handle` | string | `"rick"` | Fediverse username (e.g. `@handle@yourdomain.com`) |
| `actor.name` | string | `""` | Display name (used to seed profile on first run) |
| `actor.summary` | string | `""` | Bio text (used to seed profile on first run) |
| `actor.icon` | string | `""` | Avatar URL (used to seed profile on first run) |
| `checked` | boolean | `true` | Whether the syndicator is checked by default in the post editor |
| `alsoKnownAs` | string | `""` | Mastodon migration alias URL |
| `activityRetentionDays` | number | `90` | Days to keep activity log entries (0 = forever) |
| `storeRawActivities` | boolean | `false` | Store full raw JSON of inbound activities |
| `redisUrl` | string | `""` | Redis connection URL for delivery queue |
| `parallelWorkers` | number | `5` | Number of parallel delivery workers (requires Redis) |
| `actorType` | string | `"Person"` | Actor type: `Person`, `Service`, `Organization`, or `Group` |
| `logLevel` | string | `"warning"` | Fedify log level: `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warning"`, `"error"`, `"fatal"` |
| `timelineRetention` | number | `1000` | Maximum timeline items to keep (0 = unlimited) |
| `notificationRetentionDays` | number | `30` | Days to keep notifications (0 = forever) |
| `debugDashboard` | boolean | `false` | Enable Fedify debug dashboard at `{mountPath}/__debug__/` |
| `debugPassword` | string | `""` | Password for the debug dashboard (required if dashboard enabled) |

### Redis (Recommended for Production)

Without Redis, the plugin uses an in-process message queue. This works for development but won't survive restarts and has limited throughput.

```javascript
"@rmdes/indiekit-endpoint-activitypub": {
  redisUrl: "redis://localhost:6379",
  parallelWorkers: 5,
},
```

### Nginx Configuration (Reverse Proxy)

If you serve a static site alongside Indiekit (e.g. with Eleventy), you need nginx rules to route ActivityPub requests to Indiekit while serving HTML to browsers:

```nginx
# ActivityPub content negotiation — detect AP clients
map $http_accept $is_activitypub {
    default 0;
    "~*application/activity\+json" 1;
    "~*application/ld\+json" 1;
}

# Proxy /activitypub to Indiekit
location /activitypub {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
}

# Default: static site, but AP clients get proxied
location / {
    if ($is_activitypub) {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
    try_files $uri $uri/ $uri.html =404;
}
```

## How It Works

### Syndication (Outbound)

When you create a post via Micropub, Indiekit's syndication system calls this plugin's syndicator. The plugin:

1. Converts the JF2 post properties to an ActivityStreams 2.0 `Create(Note)` or `Create(Article)` activity
2. For replies, resolves the original post's author to include them in CC and deliver directly to their inbox
3. Sends the activity to all followers via shared inboxes using Fedify's delivery queue
4. Appends a permalink to the content so fediverse clients link back to your canonical post

### Inbox Processing (Inbound)

When remote servers send activities to your inbox:

- **Follow** → Auto-accepted, stored in `ap_followers`, notification created
- **Undo(Follow)** → Removed from `ap_followers`
- **Like** → Logged in activity log, notification created (only for reactions to your own posts)
- **Announce (Boost)** → Logged + notification (your content) or stored in timeline (followed account)
- **Create (Note/Article)** → Stored in timeline if from a followed account; notification if it's a reply or mention; stored as a direct message notification (`isDirect: true`) if addressed only to your actor
- **Update** → Updates timeline item content or refreshes follower profile data
- **Delete** → Removes from activity log and timeline
- **Move** → Updates follower's actor URL
- **Accept(Follow)** → Marks our follow as accepted
- **Reject(Follow)** → Marks our follow as rejected
- **Block** → Removes actor from our followers

### Direct Message Detection

An incoming `Create(Note)` is classified as a direct message when neither the `to` nor `cc` fields contain `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public`. This matches the convention used by Mastodon and other ActivityPub implementations for private/follower-only messages addressed to a specific actor.

The notification is stored with:
- `isDirect: true`
- `senderActorUrl` — the full URL of the sender's actor document

On reply, a native `Create(Note)` is built with `to` set only to the sender and sent via `ctx.sendActivity()`. No Micropub request is made, so no blog post is created.

### Content Negotiation

The plugin mounts a root-level router that intercepts requests from ActivityPub clients (detected by `Accept: application/activity+json` or `application/ld+json`):

- Root URL (`/`) → Redirects to the Fedify actor document
- Post URLs → Looks up the post in MongoDB, converts to AS2 JSON
- NodeInfo (`/nodeinfo/2.1`) → Delegated to Fedify

Regular browser requests pass through unmodified.

### Mastodon Migration

The plugin supports migrating from a Mastodon account:

1. **Set alias** — Configure `alsoKnownAs` with your old Mastodon profile URL. This is verified by Mastodon before allowing a Move.
2. **Import social graph** — Upload Mastodon's `following_accounts.csv` and `followers.csv` exports. Following entries are resolved via WebFinger and stored locally.
3. **Trigger Move** — From Mastodon's settings, initiate a Move to `@handle@yourdomain.com`. Mastodon notifies your followers, and compatible servers auto-refollow.
4. **Batch re-follow** — The plugin gradually sends Follow activities to all imported accounts (10 per batch, 30s between batches) so remote servers start delivering content to your inbox.

## Verification

After deployment, verify federation is working:

```bash
# WebFinger discovery
curl -s "https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:handle@yourdomain.com" | jq .

# Actor document
curl -s -H "Accept: application/activity+json" "https://yourdomain.com/" | jq .

# NodeInfo
curl -s "https://yourdomain.com/nodeinfo/2.1" | jq .
```

Then search for `@handle@yourdomain.com` from any Mastodon instance — your profile should appear.

## Admin UI Pages

All admin pages are behind IndieAuth authentication:

| Page | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `/activitypub` | Overview with follower/following counts, recent activity |
| Reader | `/activitypub/admin/reader` | Timeline from followed accounts (tabbed: notes, articles, replies, boosts, media) |
| Explore | `/activitypub/admin/reader/explore` | Browse public timelines from Mastodon-compatible instances |
| Hashtag Explore | `/activitypub/admin/reader/explore/hashtag` | Search a hashtag across multiple fediverse instances |
| Tag Timeline | `/activitypub/admin/reader/tag?tag=name` | Posts filtered by a specific hashtag, with follow/unfollow |
| Post Detail | `/activitypub/admin/reader/post?url=...` | Single post view with quote embeds and link previews |
| Notifications | `/activitypub/admin/reader/notifications` | Likes, boosts, follows, mentions, replies, and direct messages |
| Compose | `/activitypub/admin/reader/compose` | Reply composer (public AP reply, native AP DM reply, or Micropub) |
| Moderation | `/activitypub/admin/reader/moderation` | Muted/blocked accounts and keywords |
| Profile | `/activitypub/admin/profile` | Edit actor display name, bio, avatar, links |
| Followers | `/activitypub/admin/followers` | List of accounts following you |
| Following | `/activitypub/admin/following` | List of accounts you follow |
| Activity Log | `/activitypub/admin/activities` | Inbound/outbound activity history |
| Pinned Posts | `/activitypub/admin/featured` | Pin/unpin posts to your featured collection |
| Featured Tags | `/activitypub/admin/tags` | Add/remove featured hashtags |
| Migration | `/activitypub/admin/migrate` | Mastodon import wizard |
| Public Profile | `/activitypub/users/{handle}` | Public-facing profile page (no auth) |
| Debug Dashboard | `/activitypub/__debug__/` | Fedify debugger (password-protected, if enabled) |

## MongoDB Collections

The plugin creates these collections automatically:

| Collection | Description |
|---|---|
| `ap_followers` | Accounts following your actor |
| `ap_following` | Accounts you follow |
| `ap_activities` | Activity log with automatic TTL cleanup |
| `ap_keys` | RSA and Ed25519 key pairs for HTTP Signatures |
| `ap_kv` | Fedify key-value store and batch job state |
| `ap_profile` | Actor profile (single document) |
| `ap_featured` | Pinned/featured posts |
| `ap_featured_tags` | Featured hashtags |
| `ap_timeline` | Reader timeline items from followed accounts |
| `ap_notifications` | Interaction notifications (includes `isDirect` and `senderActorUrl` fields for DMs) |
| `ap_muted` | Muted actors and keywords |
| `ap_blocked` | Blocked actors |
| `ap_interactions` | Per-post like/boost tracking |

## Supported Post Types

The JF2-to-ActivityStreams converter handles these Indiekit post types:

| Post Type | ActivityStreams |
|---|---|
| note, reply, bookmark, jam, rsvp, checkin | `Create(Note)` |
| article | `Create(Article)` |
| like | `Like` |
| repost | `Announce` |
| photo, video, audio | Attachments on Note/Article |

Categories are converted to `Hashtag` tags. Bookmarks include a bookmark emoji and link.

## Fedify Workarounds and Implementation Notes

This plugin uses [Fedify](https://fedify.dev) 2.0 but carries several workarounds for issues in Fedify or its Express integration. These are documented here so they can be revisited when Fedify upgrades.

### Custom Express Bridge (instead of `@fedify/express`)

**File:** `lib/federation-bridge.js`
**Upstream issue:** `@fedify/express` uses `req.url` ([source](https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/blob/main/packages/express/src/index.ts), line 73), not `req.originalUrl`.

Indiekit plugins mount at a sub-path (e.g. `/activitypub`). Express strips the mount prefix from `req.url`, so Fedify's URI template matching breaks — WebFinger, actor endpoints, and inbox all return 404. The custom bridge uses `req.originalUrl` to preserve the full path.

The bridge also reconstructs POST bodies that Express's body parser has already consumed (`req.readable === false`). Without this, Fedify handlers like the `@fedify/debugger` login form receive empty bodies.

**Revisit when:** `@fedify/express` switches to `req.originalUrl`, or provides an option to pass a custom URL builder.

### JSON-LD Attachment Array Compaction

**File:** `lib/federation-bridge.js` (in `sendFedifyResponse()`)
**Upstream issue:** JSON-LD compaction collapses single-element arrays to plain objects.

Mastodon's `update_account_fields` checks `attachment.is_a?(Array)` and silently skips profile links (PropertyValues) when `attachment` is a plain object instead of an array. The bridge intercepts actor JSON-LD responses and forces `attachment` to always be an array.

**Revisit when:** Fedify adds an option to preserve arrays during JSON-LD serialization, or Mastodon fixes their array check.

### `.authorize()` Not Chained on Actor Dispatcher

**File:** `lib/federation-setup.js` (line ~254)
**Upstream issue:** No authenticated document loading for outgoing key fetches during signature verification.

Fedify's `.authorize()` predicate triggers HTTP Signature verification on every GET to the actor endpoint. When a remote server that requires Authorized Fetch (e.g. kobolds.online) requests our actor, Fedify tries to fetch *their* public key to verify the signature. Those servers return 401 on unsigned GETs, causing uncaught `FetchError` and 500 responses.

This means we do **not** enforce Authorized Fetch on our actor endpoint. Any server can read our actor document without signing the request.

**Revisit when:** Fedify supports using the instance actor's keys for outgoing document fetches during signature verification (i.e. authenticated document loading in the verification path, not just in inbox handlers).

### `importSpkiPem()` / `importPkcs8Pem()` — Local PEM Import

**File:** `lib/federation-setup.js` (lines ~784–816)
**Upstream change:** Fedify 1.x exported `importSpki()` for loading PEM public keys. This was removed in Fedify 2.0.

The plugin carries local `importSpkiPem()` and `importPkcs8Pem()` functions that use the Web Crypto API directly (`crypto.subtle.importKey`) to load legacy RSA key pairs stored in MongoDB from the Fedify 1.x era. New key pairs are generated using Fedify 2.0's `generateCryptoKeyPair()` and stored as JWK, so these functions only matter for existing installations that migrated from Fedify 1.x.

**Revisit when:** All existing installations have been migrated to JWK-stored keys, or Fedify re-exports a PEM import utility.

### Authenticated Document Loader for Inbox Handlers

**File:** `lib/inbox-listeners.js`
**Upstream behavior:** Fedify's personal inbox handlers do not automatically use authenticated (signed) HTTP fetches.

All `.getActor()`, `.getObject()`, and `.getTarget()` calls in inbox handlers must explicitly pass an authenticated `DocumentLoader` obtained via `ctx.getDocumentLoader({ identifier: handle })`. Without this, fetches to Authorized Fetch (Secure Mode) servers like hachyderm.io fail with 401, causing timeline items to show "Unknown" authors and missing content.

This is not a bug — Fedify requires explicit opt-in for signed fetches. But it's a pattern that every inbox handler must follow, and forgetting it silently degrades functionality.

**Revisit when:** Fedify provides an option to default to authenticated fetches in inbox handler context, or adds a middleware layer that handles this automatically.

## Known Limitations

- **No automated tests** — Manual testing against real fediverse servers
- **Single actor** — One fediverse identity per Indiekit instance
- **No Authorized Fetch enforcement** — `.authorize()` disabled on actor dispatcher (see workarounds above)
- **No image upload in reader** — Compose form is text-only
- **No custom emoji rendering** — Custom emoji shortcodes display as text
- **In-process queue without Redis** — Activities may be lost on restart
- **Existing DMs before this fork** — Notifications received before upgrading to this fork lack `isDirect`/`senderActorUrl` and won't appear in the Direct tab (resend or patch manually in MongoDB)
- **No read receipts** — Outbound DMs are stored locally but the recipient receives no read-receipt activity
